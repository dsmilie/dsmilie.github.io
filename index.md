 - **Tableau** for visualizing the data
 - **Excel** for exploratory analysis, pivot tables, and cleaning data

In this project I used aggregate functions and CTEs in SQL to take snapshots in time of the amount of money different countries owe to the IDA. I used this method to show how I would do the following: 
 - Highlight trends in financial data over time
 - Work with data where each record is repeated every month, but with updated values (i.e. same loan as last month, but is now repaid)
