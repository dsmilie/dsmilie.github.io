In this project I analyzed the effects that a longer range battery and public fast charging have on EV sales in California. In this project I used:

 - **SQL** for joining, filtering, and grouping data
 - **BigQuery** for creating tables and views
 - **Tableau** for visualizing the data
 - **Excel** for exploratory analysis, pivot tables, and cleaning data
